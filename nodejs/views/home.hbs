        			but functional forum system where users can register, log in, and post comments.

      				<p>
        			This project runs on a <strong>Node.js</strong> backend using the 
        			<strong>Express.js</strong> framework for routing and <strong>Handlebars</strong> 
        			for server-side templating. The application is deployed inside Docker containers, 
        			with <strong>Nginx</strong> acting as a reverse proxy.
